Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Prompt: Which of the python libraries from this page: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/best-python-libraries-for-machine-learning/ are best for the following project:

        The model must read in attributes and use each numerical component of the attribute to classify the attribute as an integer from 0 to 9.
        Example data: 0,0,0,2,12,2,3,7,2,6,1,6,8,2,9,4,2,7,3,1
        (the first component is a bias entry and the final component is the target)
Reason: Needed to know which library was best to use for this project (ended up not using any existing ML libraries)

Prompt: What does the readline() function return in Python 3.14? How might I read a line into a variable and immediately test if it's an empty string in the condition of a while loop?
Reason: I'm not good with python yet

Prompt: If I train my own number-classification model in python, how would I go about storing it so I can close the program, re-open it, and load the model in again?
Reason: This project is about writing the machine learning model/code, not about saving/loading, so I'm having Claude do that for me

Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Prompt: My printout function for this project takes in several parameters and displays them in the console using formatted strings. Before I print the classification of a prediction, though, I make some operations on it. Originally, I had a large if/elif statement that essentially ceil'd the classification and put it into a string. Now I want to use an inline conditional to multiply the prediction by 100 (so 0.18 will become 18), then take the last digit of that (18 will become 8) and compare that to 5. If it's equal to or over 5, multiply prediction by 10 (0.18 becomes 1.8) and raise it to the nearest integer (1.8 becomes 2), so 0.18 classifies as 2. In the case of 0.14, it becomes 14, then 4. 4 is less than 5, so it rounds *down* to 0.1 which just classifies at 1.

        Can you tell me why
        ```
        (int(prediction*100) % 10 >= 5) * math.ceil(prediction*10) + (int(prediction*100) % 10 < 5) * math.floor(prediction*10)
        ```
        doesn't do that?
Reason: Debugging (i didn't know round() was a native python function)
