Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Prompt: Which of the python libraries from this page: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/best-python-libraries-for-machine-learning/ are best for the following project:

        The model must read in attributes and use each numerical component of the attribute to classify the attribute as an integer from 0 to 9.
        Example data: 0,0,0,2,12,2,3,7,2,6,1,6,8,2,9,4,2,7,3,1
        (the first component is a bias entry and the final component is the target)
Reason: Needed to know which library was best to use for this project (ended up not using any existing ML libraries)

Prompt: What does the readline() function return in Python 3.14? How might I read a line into a variable and immediately test if it's an empty string in the condition of a while loop?
Reason: I'm not good with python yet

Prompt: If I train my own number-classification model in python, how would I go about storing it so I can close the program, re-open it, and load the model in again?
Reason: This project is about writing the machine learning model/code, not about saving/loading, so I'm having Claude do that for me
